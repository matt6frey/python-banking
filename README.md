# python-banking
This was a quick little personal project to simulate a banking interaction with a user. It only features 1 savings account with two users.
Running from the command line, the user is given a set of options after logging in: deposit, withdraw, check balance, and sign out.

There are two users: - name:Matt, password: 1234  
                     - name:Diana, password: 4321  

During your session, the amounts you deposit & withdraw will be maintained. However, I didn't code anything for external storage at the moment.
I may do so in the future, but for now, this is the primary function of the script.
